            The sun goes down
            The stars come out
            And all that counts
            Is here and now
            My universe will never be the same
            I'm glad you came

            You cast a spell on me, spell on me
            You hit me like the sky fell on me, fell on me
            And I decided you look well on me, well on me
            So let's go somewhere no one else can see, you and me

            Turn the lights out now
            Now I'll take you by the hand
            Hand you another drink
            Drink it if you can
            Can you spend a little time,
            Time is slipping away,
            Away from us so stay,
            Stay with me I can make,
            Make you glad you came

            The sun goes down
            The stars come out
            And all that counts
            Is here and now
            My universe will never be the same
            I'm glad you came
            I'm glad you came

            You cast a spell on me, spell on me
            You hit me like the sky fell on me, fell on me
            And I decided you look well on me, well on me
            So let's go somewhere no one else can see, you and me

            Turn the lights out now
            Now I'll take you by the hand
            Hand you another drink
            Drink it if you can
            Can you spend a little time,
            Time is slipping away,
            Away from us so stay,
            Stay with me I can make,
            Make you glad you came

            The sun goes down
            The stars come out
            And all that counts
            Is here and now
            My universe will never be the same
            I'm glad you came
            I'm glad you came

            I'm glad you came
            So glad you came
            I'm glad you came
            I'm glad you came

            The sun goes down
            The stars come out
            And all that counts
            Is here and now
            My universe will never be the same
            I'm glad you came
            I'm glad you came
